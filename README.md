# TypeStyle CLI

TypeStyle CLI compiles your TypeStyle files into CSS files.

## Setup

```bash
npm i typestyle-cli -g
```

## Usage
```bash
typestyle main.ts
```

## Reasons

With TypeStyle's ability to render dynamically in the browser, and its ability to render on the server on NodeJS, it is tempting to think that covers all cases.
TypeStyle CLI is intended for applications using other server technologies such as JSP, ASP.NET, and Ruby on Rails.  ASP.NET in particular has a thriving TypeScript
community that may not be able to leverage TypeStyle otherwise.
